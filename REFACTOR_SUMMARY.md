## 🚀 How to Use

### Running the Dashboard
```bash
cd "/Users/nickelodeon/Downloads/Plurimi/Portfolio project/improved backtesting"
python dashboard.py
```

### Example: Import a Portfolio
1. Create a CSV file with this format:
```csv
Ticker,Company Name,Weight (%)
AAPL,Apple Inc.,30.0
GOOGL,Alphabet Inc.,25.0
MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,25.0
AMZN,Amazon.com Inc.,20.0
```

2. In the dashboard, click "📁 Import CSV"
3. Select your file
4. Portfolio loads automatically!

### Example: Export Metrics
1. Build a portfolio and run backtest
2. Click "📊 Export Metrics to CSV"
3. Open in Excel/Sheets for analysis

### Example: Get Template
1. Click "📋 Sample CSV"
2. Opens template in browser
3. Save and modify for your needs

## 🧪 Testing

All functionality has been tested:
- ✅ Module imports work correctly
- ✅ CSV export generates valid format
- ✅ CSV import validates and parses correctly
- ✅ Invalid CSV files are rejected with clear errors
- ✅ All existing features preserved
- ✅ No linter errors in any module

## 📝 Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
**NONE!** The refactored code is 100% backward compatible.

### What Changed
- File structure (code is now split across multiple files)
- Internal organization (functions moved to appropriate modules)
- New import/export features added

### What Stayed the Same
- All UI elements
- All functionality
- All keyboard/mouse interactions
- All cached portfolios still work
- All configuration settings

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### To Understand the Code
1. Start with `dashboard.py` (main entry point)
2. Look at `dashboard_layout.py` (see the UI)
3. Check `dashboard_callbacks.py` (understand interactions)
4. Review `dashboard_utils.py` (helper functions)
5. Explore `portfolio_io.py` (import/export logic)

### To Add New Features
- **New UI element**: Add to `dashboard_layout.py`
- **New interaction**: Add callback to `dashboard_callbacks.py`
- **New utility function**: Add to `dashboard_utils.py`
- **New file format**: Extend `portfolio_io.py`
- **New backtest logic**: Modify `backtesting_utils.py`

## 📊 Code Metrics

### Before Refactoring
- **1 file**: 764 lines (monolithic)
- **Hard to navigate**: Everything in one place
- **No import/export**: Manual portfolio entry only

### After Refactoring
- **6 files**: Well-organized modules
- **Easy to navigate**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Import/Export**: Full CSV support
- **Same functionality**: Everything still works
- **Better maintainability**: Professional structure

## 🔒 Backup

The original `dashboard.py` has been backed up to:
- `dashboard_old_backup.py`

You can always revert by running:
```bash
cp dashboard_old_backup.py dashboard.py
```
