## Working with Exported Data

### Excel
1. Open the CSV file in Excel
2. Each section is clearly labeled
3. Use Excel's charting tools to create custom visualizations
4. Filter and analyze the time series data

### Python
```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the file
df = pd.read_csv('backtest_comprehensive_report.csv')

# The file has multiple sections, so you might want to parse them separately
# Or use pandas to read specific sections

# Example: Read just the time series (skip header rows)
time_series = pd.read_csv('backtest_comprehensive_report.csv', 
                          skiprows=2, 
                          nrows=None)  # Read until next section

# Create custom plots
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(time_series['Date'], time_series['Portfolio Value (Base=100)'])
plt.show()
```

### R
```r
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the file
data <- read_csv('backtest_comprehensive_report.csv', skip = 2)

# Create plots
ggplot(data, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = `Portfolio Value (Base=100)`, color = "Portfolio")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = `Benchmark SPY (Base=100)`, color = "Benchmark")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Tips

### Creating Custom Charts
- The time series data is normalized to 100, making it easy to compare
- Use log scale for portfolios with large percentage changes
- Calculate daily/monthly returns from the time series: `(Value[t] / Value[t-1]) - 1`

### Comparing Multiple Portfolios
1. Run backtests for different allocations
2. Export each report
3. Merge the time series data in Excel/Python
4. Create comparison charts

### Calculating Additional Metrics
With the time series data, you can calculate:
- Rolling Sharpe ratios
- Custom drawdown analysis
- Value at Risk (VaR)
- Maximum consecutive losses
- Win/loss streaks
- Custom correlation matrices

### Important Notes
- All percentage values are decimals multiplied by 100 (e.g., 15.23% is displayed as is)
- Dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format (ISO 8601)
- Values are normalized to base 100 for easy comparison
- The report includes the same data shown in the dashboard charts
